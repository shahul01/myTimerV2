  # bugs:
    timer:
      ✔ timer still gives switching error @done(23-07-23 12:38)
        - as it is a new timer(?) rather than referencing the component it creates and reuses it
        - fix:
          - on pause: send 'currentTimer' to parent
          - on resume: resume from last paused 'currentTimer'
    ☐ sync
      ☐ sync by title has repeated titles...

    electron:
      ☐ refresh fn not working when frameless

    ☐ Warning:
      ✔ 1. Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component. @done(23-08-02 14:47)
        - This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application.
        - To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in a useEffect cleanup function. at Timer


  # important:
    - top:

      - top 5:
        - (fix bugs)
        ✔ reset timer @done(23-08-19 00:41)
        ✔ for mac: always visible @done(23-08-19 00:57)
        - id instead of name (use 'name ===' to filter)
        - backup and restore w/ config file
        - testing

      - rest:
        - double click - pause / resume
        - change bg color on running
        - local storage
        - user auth
        - refactor

    ☐ Input mask
    ☐ timer string validation:
      ☐ regex

      ☐ restore
	    ☐ as jsonc config gile


    ☐ web version
      - add user roles

    ☐ phone version:
      ☐ sync:
        ☐ can get tasks and current level of completion
        ☐ one touch sync


  # design:
    ✔ no window titlebar @done(23-07-31 14:13)
    ☐ when running, change body color
    ☐ to timer lists:
      ☐ update height dynamically depending on tasks list length, then after say, 5 timers,
      ☐ add scrollbars
    ☐ replace border with fading border

    ☐ size
      ☐ resizable
        ☐ remembers dimensions even after toggling different sizes

  # techstack:
    ☐ db
      - postgresql
    ☐ tailwind
      - for responsiveness(?)

  # ideas:
    ☐ timer:
      ☐ reset
        ☐ and before reset, send timespent to db
      ☐ add delete option to task
      ☐ on double click:
        - show elapsed timer
        - pause / resume
      ☐ id as identifier instead of title:
        ☐ replace title with id, which could be same as title, so title can be edited
        ☐ make title editable
      ☐ make task's timer editable
        - ie each task has default timer, make it changable
        ☐ before updating the timer, prompt to save data to db
          - create timespent prop for ITask, which persists for entire day

    ☐ Mac: show on all windows / desktops
    ☐ refresh react home page
    ☐ integrate with db
    ☐ executable file:
      ☐ win
      ☐ mac
      ☐ integrated with db
      ☐ make it portable

    ☐ minimise btn
    ☐ remove unicode and emoji btn and replace with svg buttons
      ☐ sync:
        ☐ btn to backup timer table within db

    ☐ blink
      ☐ on end
      ☐ when paused, once every 15 mins

    ☐ view raw data on db

    ☐ open source the repo(?)

    ☐ localStorage
      - save every elapsed sec to lclStrg
      - 'when' crash && if lclstrg has data && more time elapsed on lclStrg than db
        - ask to restore from lclStrg and push to db

    ☐ PWA
    ☐ Browser only
    ☐ offline only

    ☐ stopwatch:
      ☐ multiples in list just like timers but with stopwatch

    ☐ draggable anywhere
    ☐ timer list drag and droppable
    ☐ hotkeys
      ☐ resume and pause

    ☐ remember position on screen and monitor
    ☐ time end alert:
      ✔ beep @done(23-08-01 20:20)
      ✔ message dialog box @done(23-08-01 20:20)
      ☐ reverse countdown
    ☐ heatmap


  # refactor:
    ☐ sync.tsx → too many loops...
      - rewrite 3x
      - use chatgpt
    ☐ replace `return` for guard clauses with `Error` if necessary


  # offline:
    ☐ save fonts locally


  # testing:
    type:
      ☐ unit testing
        ☐ timer:
          ☐ runs for particular seconds etc
            ☐ unit testing
          ☐ play pause
        ☐ util function
          ☐ important ones
          ☐ possibly buggy ones
      ☐ e2e testing
        ☐ CRUD
        ☐ sync
