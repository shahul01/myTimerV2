  # bugs:
    timer:
      ✔ timer still gives switching error @done(23-08-27 00:56)
        - as it is a new timer(?) rather than referencing the component it creates and reuses it
        - fix:
          - on pause: send 'currentTimer' to parent
          - on resume: resume from last paused 'currentTimer'
        - solved by invalidating context on success
    ✔ sync @done(23-08-27 00:58)
      ✔ sync by title has repeated titles... @done(23-08-27 00:56)
    ☐ reset error

    electron:
      ☐ refresh fn not working when frameless

    ☐ Warning:
      ✔ 1. Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component. @done(23-08-02 14:47)
        - This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application.
        - To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in a useEffect cleanup function. at Timer

  # design:
    ✔ no window titlebar @done(23-07-31 14:13)
    ☐ when running, change body color
    ☐ remove unicode and emoji btn and replace with svg buttons

    ☐ to timer lists:
      ☐ update height dynamically depending on tasks list length, then after say, 5 timers,
      ☐ add scrollbars
    ✔ replace border with fading border @done(23-08-28 00:03)

    ☐ size
      ✔ resizable @done(23-08-28 00:03)
        ☐ remembers dimensions even after toggling different sizes
      ☐ font auto adjust on resize
      ☐ on modal, have prop for modal that resizes the electron app acc to modal props

    ☐ responsive
    ☐ theme color per task



  # techstack:
    ☐ db
      - postgresql
    ☐ tailwind
      - for responsiveness(?)
    ☐ prisma studio



  # ideas:
    versions:
      ☐ electron:
        ☐ Mac: show on all windows / desktops
        ☐ minimise btn - mainWindow.minimize();
        ☐ refresh react home page
        ☐ integrate with db
        ☐ executable file:
          ☐ make it portable
          ☐ win
          ☐ mac
          ☐ integrated with db
        ☐ view raw data on db
          ☐ table name in dropdown, once selected
          ☐ shows all the data

        ☐ remember position on screen and monitor
        ☐ add return guards when ServeMode != 'electron'


      ☐ web:
        ☐ modes:
          - offline only ready
          ☐ online
            - add user roles
          ☐ needs server on web to run FE
          ☐ one source of truth timer
            - eg pausing web version pauses electron's timer for that user...
        ☐ PWA - for both modes


        ☐ phone:


    ☐ timer:
      ☐ reset
        ✔ and before reset, send timespent to db @done(23-08-27 01:05)
        ☐ after reset, sel timer shouldnt change
      ☐ add delete option to task
      ☐ on double click on timer in <Timer /> and timer in <Timers />:
        ✔ pause / resume that timer @done(23-10-17 11:47)
        - show elapsed timer
      ✔ id as identifier instead of title: @done(23-08-27 23:47)
        ✔ replace title with id, which could be same as title, so title can be edited @done(23-08-27 01:05)
      ☐ editable
        ☐ title
        ☐ timerInput:
          - ie each task has default timer, make it changable
          ☐ before updating the timer, prompt to save data to db
            - create timespent prop for ITask, which persists for entire day



    ☐ Sync:
      ☐ can get tasks and current level of completion
      ☐ one touch sync
      ☐ btn to backup timer table within db

    ☐ Backup and restore config:
      feature:
        ✔ when clicking particular btn @done(23-08-27 23:38)
        ☐ basic
        ✔ backup @done(23-09-19 17:32)
        ☐ restore
        - export type
          ✔ as .jsonc config file @done(23-10-17 11:49)
          - .js file, check with jsonc parser (?)

      code:
        ☐ add reducers for hard coded values in Sync/ExportData.tsx(+)


    ☐ local Storage:
      - save every elapsed sec or min to lclStrg.
      - 'when' crash && if lclStrg has data && more time elapsed on lclStrg than db
        - ask to restore from lclStrg and push to db

    ☐ time end alert:
      ✔ beep @done(23-08-01 20:20)
      ✔ message dialog box @done(23-08-01 20:20)
      ☐ reverse countdown

    ☐ stopwatch:
      ☐ multiples in list just like timers but with stopwatch

    ☐ blink:
      ☐ on time end
      ☐ when paused, once every 15 mins

    ☐ timer list drag and droppable
    ☐ hotkeys
      ☐ resume and pause

    ☐ heatmap

    ☐ publicity(OR)
      ☐ SAAS
      ✔ Open source the repo(?) @done(23-09-19 17:32)
        ✔ block push to main branch @done(23-09-19 17:32)



  # refactor:
    ☐ sync.tsx → too many loops...
      - rewrite 3x
      - use chatgpt
    ☐ App.tsx → too much code...

    - type:
      ☐ replace `any`
        ☐ with proper type
        ☐ with unknown(?)
      ☐ replace `return` for guard clauses with `Error` if necessary
      ☐ logByDate has 2 interface, one global and one infile, remove one.

    ☐ add version to api

          ☐ important ones
          ☐ possibly buggy ones

    ☐ Reduce loop count(+) in Sync



  # security:
    ☐ validation:
      ☐ Input mask
      ☐ timer string:
        ☐ regex
        ☐ zod
          ☐ z.object().strip()
      ☐ prisma
        ☐ use PrismaClient to get types
        ☐ create zod schema from prisma schema
    ☐ User auth to connect with db

    ☐ Warning type log on Dev Tools: Electron Security Warning (Insecure Content-Security-Policy) This renderer process has either no Content Security
        Policy set or a policy with "unsafe-eval" enabled. This exposes users of
        this app to unnecessary security risks.

      For more information and help, consult
      https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security.
      This warning will not show up
      once the app is packaged.

    ☐ turn on recently disabled rules(+)
      - in .eslintrc.js
    ☐ remove eslint in-file/in-line disable
      ☐ remove disabled rule for exhaustive useEffect deps

    ☐ chatgpt - owasp recommendation for techstacks
      ☐ Next.js, React.js, Svelte Kit:
        ☐ Ensure you're not rendering user-generated content as raw HTML.
        ☐ Use JSX or Svelte templates to automatically escape content.
        ☐ Implement CSP headers to restrict which sources can execute scripts.
      ☐ Electron:
        ☐ Keep Electron and its dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
        ☐ Avoid loading remote content that might introduce security risks.
        ☐ Utilize Electron's context isolation for rendering.
      ☐ Node.js + Express:
        ☐ Utilize security middleware like Helmet.js to set security-related HTTP headers.
        ☐ Use a security scanning tool to identify vulnerabilities in your dependencies (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check).
      ☐ PostgreSQL:
        ☐ Implement database access control with proper roles and permissions.
        ☐ Use parameterized queries or an ORM like Sequelize to prevent SQL injection.
